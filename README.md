# Railway Reservation System

## Project Description
This C++ program is a railway reservation system that allows users to book train tickets, view train schedules, and manage their bookings. It incorporates various features and concepts from programming fundamentals. Below is an overview of the program's features and a brief explanation of the code structure.

## Features
1. **Menu System:** The program has a menu-driven system that offers options such as login, viewing train schedules, booking tickets, and exiting the system.

2. **User Registration:** Users can register themselves by providing their unique ID, name, age, gender, CNIC, address, and contact information.

3. **Train Schedule:** Users can view the schedule of available trains, including their departure and destination.

4. **Ticket Booking:** Users can choose a train, select the type of seat (first class, second class, or economy class), specify the number of seats they want to book, and calculate the total bill.

5. **Bill Generation:** The program generates a bill for the booked seats and allows users to confirm the booking.

6. **Time Handling:** The program provides different train timings for users to choose from, and it validates user input.

7. **Error Handling:** The program handles invalid input gracefully and provides appropriate error messages.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into functions, structures, and switch-case statements to implement different functionalities:

### Functions
- `start()`: Displays a welcome message when the program starts.
- `menu()`: Displays the main menu and handles menu options.
- `login()`: Allows users to register by providing their information.
- `schedule()`: Displays the train schedule and handles train selection.
- `timing()`: Handles the selection of train timings.
- `booking()`: Manages the ticket booking process, including seat selection and bill generation.
- `end()`: Displays a thank you message and exits the program.

### Structures
- `mainlogin`: Stores user registration information.
- `time`: Represents the train timings.
- `generate`: Contains a flag for generating bills.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Choose options from the main menu.
3. Follow the prompts to complete the desired action (e.g., registration, train selection, booking).
4. Enjoy the railway reservation system!

## Note
This program provides a basic railway reservation system and can be further improved and extended with additional features and enhancements. The code can be refactored to improve readability and maintainability.

Feel free to reach out for any questions or improvements to the program. Happy coding!
